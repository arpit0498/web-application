Make sure to save your screen shots JPG or PNG files and keep them less than 1MB.  You must include the URL bar in all of your screen shots and the software must be running in your PHP server (i.e. file:// urls will not be accepted)",
  "grading": "Please review carefully.  The actual points are less important and useful comments about what might be wrong and need fixing.  You cannot re-submit your assignment unless the instructor allows you to resubmit.",
